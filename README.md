Our project, A Personalized Meal Recommendation System, is a data-driven solution designed to improve the health outcomes of patients with specific nutritional needs. By combining machine learning with local food sourcing, we provide personalized meal plans that are not only nutritionally balanced but also fresh, delicious, and accessible.

Medically tailored meals (MTMs) are crucial for patients managing chronic diseases, but current solutions often fall short in terms of taste and freshness. Processed meals, while convenient, lack the appeal and nutritional density of fresh, locally sourced ingredients. This leads to poor patient adherence and suboptimal health outcomes.

We built a system that:
 - Personalizes Meal Plans: Using patient data (age, gender, health metrics, dietary preferences), our machine learning model predicts the optimal caloric intake, macronutrient distribution (protein, carbs, fats), and meal plans.
 - Recommends Fresh Ingredients: The system guides users to local farmers' markets where they can purchase fresh, locally sourced ingredients, complete with price transparency.
 - Supports Local Economies: By connecting patients with local farmers and producers, we strengthen the local food system while providing nutrient-dense, flavorful meals.

How It Works:
 - Data Input: Patients provide their health metrics, dietary preferences, and lifestyle information.
 - Machine Learning Model: Our MultiOutputRegressor with RandomForestRegressor predicts personalized nutritional needs.
 - Meal Planning: The system generates balanced meal plans for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, using fresh, local ingredients.
 - Farmers' Market Integration: Patients receive recommendations for local markets where they can buy the ingredients, along with prices and locations.

Impact:
 - Improved Health Outcomes: Tailored meals improve patient adherence and health management.
 - Fresh and Delicious: Local ingredients enhance flavor and appeal, making meals more enjoyable.
 - Support for Local Economies: Strengthening local food systems by sourcing from regional farmers and producers.
 - Sustainability: Reducing reliance on processed foods and promoting a healthier, more sustainable food system.

Future Plans:
 - Expand integration with more local farmers' markets.
 - Develop a mobile app for easier access to meal recommendations and market information.
 - Implement real-time updates for ingredient availability and prices.
